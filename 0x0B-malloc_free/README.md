This folder contains my work done with malloc function.

0-create_array.c : creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char
1-strdup.c : returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
2-str_concat.c : concatenates two strings
